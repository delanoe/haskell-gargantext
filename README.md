# Gargantext Instance, Backend

## Releases

[Release soon, bugs are welcome, please help to contribute].

## About this project

Gargantext is a collaborative web protocol for the exploration of sets
of unstructured texts.

Scientifically, its ergonomic experimental tools help to combine tools
from natural language processing, text and data mining, complex networks
analysis and interactive data visualization.

"To pave the way toward new kinds of interactions with your
digital corpora."

Technically, the [client](#gargantext-purescript) connects to the
instances. If the client tries to be ergonomic, it only ask for the
instance API, either locally or remote; with some local secured
optimizations.

This software is a free software, developed by the CNRS Complex Systems
Institute of Paris ÃŽle-de-France (ISC-PIF) and its partners.

Source code is the master spec of this project. It explains its
algorithmic protocol to map knowledge in a collaborative way. Three main
parts:
- Core.(Text|...)
- Api.Rest
- Data.SQL

The types map the transition between each state, either from outside
(Api.Rest).

## Database schema (garGraph)

In our database, which is a way to manage persistence of data, the
schema describes the geometrical structure of our data.

In data-base, atoms of Text are ngrams or context(ngrams) in nodes.
Nodes are branches in a Tree and [Node Node] is an link in Graph.

Node Node is either a corpus and its documents (collection of texts)
or an annuaire and its contacts (collective of individuals).

Node, Node Ngrams is each ngrams but with its full context of nodes.
metrics. Why not Node-Ngrams only ? We add a "Node" as a layer for list.
That enable to have a layer on our data.


## Public Rest API (GargApi)

## General API Information
* The base endpoint is: **https://api.gargantext.org**
* All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
* Data is returned in **ascending** order. Oldest first, newest last.
* All time and timestamp related fields are in **milliseconds**.

## HTTP Return Codes

* HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for malformed requests;
  the issue is on the sender's side.
* HTTP `403` return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
* HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
* HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving `429` codes.
* HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on
  Binance's side.
  It is important to **NOT** treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is
  **UNKNOWN** and could have been a success.


## Error Codes
* Any endpoint can return an ERROR

Sample Payload below:
```javascript
{
  "code": -1121,
  "msg": "Invalid symbol."
}

```
## General Information on Endpoints
* For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.
* For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a
  `query string` or in the `request body` with content type
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. You may mix parameters between both the
  `query string` and `request body` if you wish to do so.
* Parameters may be sent in any order.
* If a parameter sent in both the `query string` and `request body`, the
  `query string` parameter will be used.


# Endpoint security type
* Each endpoint has a security type that determines the how you will
  interact with it. This is stated next to the NAME of the endpoint.
    * If no security type is stated, assume the security type is NONE.
* API-keys are passed into the Rest API via the `X-GARG-APIKEY`
  header.
* API-keys and secret-keys **are case sensitive**.
* API-keys can be configured to only access certain types of secure endpoints.
 For example, one API-key could be used for WRITE only, while another API-key
 can access (READ) everything except for WRITE routes.
* By default, API-keys can access all secure routes.

Security Type | Description
------------ | ------------
NONE  | Endpoint can be accessed freely.
WRITE | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
USER_DATA | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
USER_TEXT | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.
TEXT_DATA | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.

* `WRITE` and `USER_DATA` endpoints are `SIGNED` endpoints.


## Installation

Disclaimer: this project is still on development, this is work in
progress. Please report and improve this documentation if you encounter
issues.

### Build Core Code
#### Docker
  curl -sSL https://gitlab.iscpif.fr/gargantext/haskell-gargantext/raw/master/devops/docker-install | sh

#### Debian
  curl -sSL https://gitlab.iscpif.fr/gargantext/haskell-gargantext/raw/master/devops/debian-install | sh

### Add dependencies

1. CoreNLP is needed (EN and FR); This dependency will not be needed
   soon.
  - wget https://dl.gargantext.org/coreNLP.tar.bz2
  - tar xvjf coreNLP.tar.bz2
  - ./startServer.sh

2. Louvain C++ needed to draw the socio-semantic graphs
  - git clone https://gitlab.iscpif.fr/gargantext/clustering-louvain-cplusplus.git
  - cd clustering-louvain-cplusplus
  - ./install

### Initialization

Users has to be created first (user1 is created as instance):

- stack install
- ~/.local/bin/gargantext-init "gargantext.ini"

## Use Cases

### Multi-User with Graphical User Interface (Server Mode)

~/.local/bin/stack --docker exec gargantext-server -- --ini "gargantext.ini" --run Prod
Then you can log in with user1:1resu


### Command Line Mode tools

#### Simple cooccurrences computation and indexation from a list of Ngrams

stack --docker exec gargantext-cli -- CorpusFromGarg.csv ListFromGarg.csv Ouput.json
